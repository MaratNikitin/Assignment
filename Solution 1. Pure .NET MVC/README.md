# Assignment

This repo contains a completed assignment. A backup file for a SQL Server database is attached (it's in the "Extra Files" folder). The database should be installed, and the connection string in the appsettings.json file (removed it from the Assignment2023Context.cs file as per best practices) should be updated accordingly before running the application.
The solution has an ASP .NET7 Core MVC project connecting with the SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Database First approach was implemented) and a separate .NET7 class library project where entity classes are stored.
Two videos with overviews of the database and application can be found in the "Extra Files" folder.
