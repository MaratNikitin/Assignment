# Assignment

This repo contains a completed assignment. A backup file for a SQL Server database is attached (it's in the "Extra Files" folder). The database should be installed, and the connection string should be updated accordingly before running the application.
The solution has an ASP .NET7 Core project connecting with the SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Database First approach was implemented) and a separate class library project where entity classes are stored.
Two videos with overviews of the database and application can be found in the "Extra Files" folder.
