# Assignment

This repo contains two completed versions of an assignment.

# Solution 1. Pure .NET MVC

A backup file for a SQL Server database is attached (it's in the "Extra Files" folder). The database should be installed, and the connection string in the appsettings.json file (removed it from the Assignment2023Context.cs file as per best practices) should be updated accordingly before running the application.
The solution has an ASP .NET7 Core MVC project connecting with the SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Database First approach was implemented) and a separate .NET7 class library project where entity classes are stored.
Two videos with overviews of the database and application can be found in the "Extra Files" folder.

# Solution 2. .NET7 Web API + React.js

The database (in the 'Solution 1. Pure .NET MVC\Extra Files' folder) should be installed, and the connection string in the appsettings.json file (removed it from the Assignment2023Context.cs file as per best practices) should be updated accordingly before running the Web API application.
The Web API solution has an ASP .NET7 Core Web API project connecting with the SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core (Database First approach was implemented). The React.js application might need updating the API's port number in the 'src/Variables.js' file.
Two videos with overviews of the .NET Core Web API and React.js applications can be found in the "Extra Files" folder.
